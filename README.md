Keyboard PCB, and acrylic case inspired by the TGR Alice layout designed by me.

I provide these PCBs as a reference for design. Using them within your projects will require a will to do research of one's own and to learn the workings of them, potentially fixing issues if they exist.
I provide these PCBs without liability and without any guarantees regarding functionality, as expressed in the MIT license under which all of these PCBs are licensed.
